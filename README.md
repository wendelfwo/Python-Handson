# Python-Handson

This is a repository which brings together solutions of programming problems of the 
[URI platform](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/categories). Problems are 
separated by topics (beginner, ad-hoc, strings, etc) and made in Python. In addition, 
I am applying coding conventions to stylize Python codes based on [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id8).
